# tar1090-db

Database repo for tar1090 using the database maintained by Mictronics (https://www.mictronics.de/aircraft-database/)

## Usage

```bash
./update.sh        # build the aircraft database
./csv.sh           # generate aircraft.csv.gz for readsb --db-file
```

## Developer Workflow

- Make changes on the `dev` branch
- When ready for production, cherry-pick your commits to `master`

The `db/` directory is auto-generated by the build process and should not be edited directly.
